# microservice-bonanza
microservice fun times with Express.

These are 4 seperate microservices written with Express to demonstrate one possible way to structure your pipeline.

# Getting Started

* `git clone https://github.com/erikyuzwa/microservice-bonanza.git`
* `npm install` or `yarn install`

# Configuration

While "true" Microservices should require zero-configuration, there's always a case where your deployment network
dictates some specifics.
